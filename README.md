# My Personal Project

## Project Description 

My personal project is a fitness application called *JavaFit*. 

This app will be available for anyone who is willing to begin their fitness journey; therefore, everyone can use it!

In this app, *you* will be able to...
- ***set new fitness goals***
- ***track your calories***

This project is interesting to me because I love fitness and health. I enjoy working out and progressively making my body stronger/healthier.
